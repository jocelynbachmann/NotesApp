# Notes App

This is a simple note-taking application that I built while learning Java. Users can:
- Create notes with titles and bodies of text
- View all notes in one place and select a note to view its contents
- Save and load notes from file
- Delete notes
- Search all notes for a word or phrase and view a list of notes containing the search input (console version only)

## To run with GUI:
Run NotesUI.java 

## To run console version:
Run Main.java
