# Note-Taking App

## Project Overview

This is a simple note-taking application that can be used by anyone, but is particularly useful for students, who 
may want to take notes in class or keep track of homework and due dates. Features include:
- **Automatically saves note files** when user closes the application
- Options to **stylize text** (e.g. bold, italic, highlight)
- **Search bar** (i.e. can search for specific words or phrases across all notes) 

This project is of particular interest as a student who uses the iOS notes app often, but feel it
lacks some functionality. Though this project will cover only basic features, I would like to eventually 
build it into an application that functions more smoothly and offers more features than what I currently use.
