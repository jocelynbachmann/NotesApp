# Note-Taking App

## Project Overview

This is a simple note-taking application that can be used by anyone, but is particularly useful for students, who 
may want to take notes in class or keep track of homework and due dates. Features include:
- Ability to create notes with titles and bodies of text, and view all notes in one place
- Option to **save and load** notes from file
- Option to delete notes

This project is of particular interest to me as I am a student who uses the iOS notes app often, but feel it
lacks some functionality. Though this project will cover only basic features, I would like to eventually 
build it into an application that functions more smoothly and offers more features than what I currently use.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create and add a title and text to a note
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the title and text of a note after creating it

 select a note to open (i.e. view the text of the note)
